# C100 Heroku Hosting

[Terraform][terraform] project to create the production environment for the [C100 Family Justice application][c100-app] in [Heroku]:[heroku].

[terraform]: https://www.terraform.io/
[c100-app]: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/c100-application
[heroku]: https://heroku.com

## Setup

To use this project, you need a Heroku API key. You can get this from the MoJ Digital Heroku account(credentials available from Rattic).

    cp dotenv.example .env

Edit `.env` and update the environment variables, then;

    source .env
    make build

This will create your (empty) application on Heroku.

If you have created your application in the shared MoJ Heroku account, you may need to add your personal account as a collaborator, so that you can deploy your code without having to log in using the main MoJ Heroku credentials.
